# React Pok√©dex 

A simple prototype to demonstrate how to use Context and HOCs to manage state. 

## Setup
`npm install` and then `npm start`.

## Branches
Each branch represents a step in the process.

- **[master](https://github.com/siuangie91/react-pokedex/tree/master)** -- Basic setup. No working functionality.
- **[1-create-context](https://github.com/siuangie91/react-pokedex/tree/1-create-context)** -- create the Context and Provider
- **[2-use-provider](https://github.com/siuangie91/react-pokedex/tree/2-use-provider)** -- using the Context Provider without HOCs
- **[3-hocs](https://github.com/siuangie91/react-pokedex/tree/3-hocs)** -- refactor code to use HOCs
- ![current](https://img.shields.io/badge/current-blue.svg) **4-decorators** -- refactor code to use decorators

## Walkthrough of 4-decorators
*In order to use decorators, we need to add a Babel plugin. Since we set up this app with `create-react-app`, we must first run `npm eject`, which copies all the config files and dependencies into our project. Then we have to add this Babel plugin to our `package.json`. (These steps have already been done.)*

**You _must_ run `npm install` again and then `npm start` because the config has changed due to our ejection.**
